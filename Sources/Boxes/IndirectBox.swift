/// A `Box` that keeps makes its `Value` indirect so it can be on the heap if needed.

/// This is useful when you have a struct type and what to nest another instance of the same type within itself since you can't normally do this.
///
/// Generally you shouldn't need to use this `Box` type directly and can instead use the `@Indirect` property wrapper.
///
/// - Note: This uses value semantics, if you want reference semantics see `IndirectReferenceBox`.
