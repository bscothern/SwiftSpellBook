/// - Important:
///     You must unlock this lock from the same thread that locked it.
///     Attempts to unlock from a different thread will cause an assertion aborting the process.

/// - Important:
///     There is no attempt at fairness or lock ordering.
///     e.g. an unlocker can potentially immediately reacquire the lock before a woken up waiter gets an opportunity to attempt to acquire the lock.
///     This may be advantageous for performance reasons, but also makes starvation of waiters a possibility.
