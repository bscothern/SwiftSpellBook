/// The `SafeManagedBuffer` type adding convinence and help working with a `ManagedBuffer` in a safe manner.
///
/// Generally `SafeManagedBuffer` and `ManagedBuffer` should be avoided.
/// They are almost always slower and less memory efficient than other data structures and types giving the same behavior.
///
/// # Custom Inits
///
/// Creating a custom init on a `SafeManagedBuffer` is not done the same way as in other types.
/// This is because `ManagedBuffer` has one `init` that is private and you create an instance via the factory function `create(minimumCapacity:makingHeaderWith:)`.
///
/// To bypass this restriction and create a more swifty interface on your types with a typical init you will need to follow this pattern:
/// 1) Create your type without any inits and have it inherit from `SafeManagedBuffer`.
/// 2) Create an extension, typeically named the same as the type you are creating with a leading underscore since it is a private implimentation detail.
///     Note that the access modifier on this protocol will define the maximum accessiblity of your init.
/// 3) Have this new protocol conform to `SafeManagedBufferProtocol` and constrain the `HeaderValue` and `Element` to match what they will be.
/// 4) Create an extension on your new protocol with your custom `init` and inside of it call another `init` that is available to you eventually calling an init on `SafeManagedBufferProtocol` (they are actually on`_SafeManagedBufferProtocol` which is an implimentation detail of `SafeManagedBufferProtocol`).
/// 5) Go back to your class and have it conform to your new protocol.
///
/// Here is a basic example of how you could copy an array out to an `SafeManagedBuffer` object in an init.
/// ```swift
/// public final class ExampleBuffer<Element>: SafeManagedBuffer<Void, Element>, _ExampleBuffer {}
///
/// public protocol _ExampleBuffer: SafeManagedBufferProtocol where HeaderValue == Void {}
///
/// extension _ExampleBuffer {
///     public init(elements: [Element]) {
///         self.init(
///             minimumCapacity: elements.count,
///             deinitStrategy: .minimumCapacity,
///             makingHeaderWith: { _ in Void() },
///             thenFinishInit: {
///                 $0.withUnsafeMutablePointerToElements { bufferElements in
///                     var offset = 0
///                     elements.forEach { element in
///                         bufferElements.advanced(by: offset).initialize(to: element)
///                         offset += 1
///                     }
///                 }
///             }
///         )
///     }
/// }
